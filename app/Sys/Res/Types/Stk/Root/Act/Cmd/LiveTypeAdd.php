 * when live type is being added , this is a set operation,

 * if the down-set has already applied to a live,
 * then this is applied before those changes (so make the down-set able to mask and filter the upset,
 * even if upset changed later
 *
 * down-set can apply the same type again to reset the values, but that is not seen up-set
 * down-set applying live does not affect up-set
 *
 * when child set destroyed, live attributes go away if the same element above does not have that live applied or is masked by another live
 *
 * live types can mask events to attributes they cover up, if they handle the same event
 *  if the live has a more derived attribute, then it masks the parent attribute rules
 *  if the live has a less derived attribute, then it will filter the attribute it is an ancestor of
 *   the filter chain order is the applied live order
