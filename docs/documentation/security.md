When an element is copied from server A and B, and then comes back to A, then A knows if the data went through the rules
if the data is encrypted, there can be two types of encryption, that the ns took care of it, or the originating server did it.

Data in elements do not have to be encrypted, but if it is, then does not matter which intermediate servers pass the element back
