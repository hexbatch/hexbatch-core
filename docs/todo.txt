todo types can have bounds of map or shape. Top level sets can have either bound
todo talk about clipping elements to group op targets based on location bounds of the type and the destination set
todo talk about how live types on an element does not change its bounds, just attribute shapes
todo talk about what triggers interesection events and what does not (attribute on, type on, element enter set trigger) time bounds do not

Concept introduction (how it works mechanically)

This tries to put things into groups. The things are called elements, and the groups are called sets. An element is some json, with some things that power it to make it do actions based on what else is in the set. Elements are made from something called types. One type can make many elements. The logic of the element, how it behaves, is based on the type.
